    Imagine a food delivery app where:

    Every food item can be prepared (common behavior).
    Pizza is prepared differently.
    Burger is prepared differently.
    Pasta is prepared differently.

    Same action (prepare food) but different implementations based on the food typeâ€”this is method overriding.*/
